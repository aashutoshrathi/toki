# Changelog

## 2.1.5 - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Launch at login toggle in Settings, backed by `SMAppService` so it stays in sync with System Settings > Login Items (including surfacing a "Needs approval" prompt when macOS requires it).
- `toki status` CLI (`--compact` / `--json`) for scripting and shell prompt integrations. Reads a cache the app writes after every refresh at `~/.toki/status.json` instead of doing a live fetch, so it's instant.
- Optional Developer ID signing and notarization in the release pipeline, gated entirely on repo secrets - inactive (falls back to the existing ad-hoc signing) until those are configured.
- Gemini CLI agent detection, matching the existing Copilot tier: shows up in the Agents tab when running, and in onboarding as signed-in (via its Google OAuth token). No quota tracking - confirmed directly against the `@google/gemini-cli` package source that it has no such API for personal accounts, same situation as Copilot.
- "Add account" button in the header (next to Settings), reopening the connect screen after the first account is already set up - useful for starting with just Claude and adding Codex (or anything else) later without hand-editing config.json. Only offers providers not already connected.

### Changed

- Internal restructuring, no user-facing changes: split the `UsageStore` god-object (685 lines mixing config/onboarding, refresh, sessions, notifications, AI insight, and debug logging) into per-concern extension files, and broke up `SmartPanels.swift` (a 532-line grab-bag of unrelated views accumulated across the last few features) into one file per view, matching the rest of the codebase's one-type-per-file convention.

## 2.1.4 - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Click-to-connect onboarding: when no `config.json` exists yet, the popover scans for Claude Code (Keychain), Codex (`~/.codex/auth.json`), and OpenCode (local database) and lets you add them with one click instead of hand-writing JSON. A manual JSON editor link remains for advanced setups.

### Fixed

- `ConfigLoader.save` now creates `~/.toki` if it doesn't exist yet, so the first-ever config write (including from the new onboarding flow) no longer fails on a fresh install.

## 2.1.3 - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- Fixed a launch crash in the released app: resources are now resolved via `Bundle.main` from `Contents/Resources` instead of the SwiftPM `Bundle.module` accessor, which fatal-errored because its resource bundle can't sit at the code-signed app root.

## 2.1.2 - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Settings editor for the AI insight instructions (`aiInstructions`), with the default prompt shown as placeholder and reset-to-default; saving regenerates the insight immediately. Shown only when on-device AI is available.

### Changed

- Release builds now run on the macOS 26 runner so the on-device AI insight (Foundation Models) is compiled into the shipped app instead of being stripped on an older SDK.

### Fixed

- Settings back button now responds across its whole surface, not only the chevron glyph.
- AI instructions editor surfaces a save failure inline instead of showing a false "Saved".

## 2.1.1 - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Active-agent discovery for Codex, Claude Code, Copilot CLI, OpenCode, and ChatGPT-hosted Codex with runtime, terminal metadata, and working directory display.
- Conversation title and project folder display for each agent, shown relative to home (`~/Code/project`).
- Best-effort navigation to matching terminal tabs (iTerm2, Terminal, WezTerm) and editor-hosted sessions (VS Code, Cursor, ChatGPT) via bundle ID resolution.
- On-device AI insight card using Apple Intelligence (macOS 26+) for natural-language account summaries, with a deterministic recommendation fallback and expandable suggestions.
- Session recording banner with a live animated stopwatch while tracking is active.
- Session play/stop toggle moved to the header controls bar.
- OpenCode usage tracking from its local SQLite database (today's spend, tokens, all-time totals), auto-detected when available.
- OpenCode SVG logo resource.
- Claude SVG logo resource.
- Automatic GitHub release checks and verified one-click DMG installation.
- Six-hour update polling with a manual "Check now" action in Settings.
- Privacy-safe rotating local diagnostics and an attached debug-report share action.
- Config migration from `name`/`provider`/`id` to `label`/`type` with automatic migration and `.bak` backup.
- In-app JSON config editor.
- Optional `aiInstructions` config field for customizing the on-device LLM prompt.
- Homebrew cask installation (`brew install --cask toki`).
- Cask update automation script.
- Full-page settings view replacing the Settings tab.
- Copilot provider entry (agent-detection only, no quota tracking).

### Changed

- Release bundles are ad-hoc signed so downloaded updates can be verified before installation.
- Overview panel now uses a unified AIInsightCard replacing three separate stat blocks.
- Account config format migrated to `label`/`type`; legacy configs load and convert automatically.
- Provider logos switched to SVG assets with fallback marks for new providers.

### Fixed

- Pipe deadlock in subprocess runner: drain stdout and stderr before `waitUntilExit`.
- Update download URL validation now enforces `https` scheme alongside host check.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Smart recommendation panel that suggests the healthiest AI coding account to use next.
- One-click switch to the recommended Claude Code account from the overview (Claude Code accounts only, via `claude-swap`).
- Native low-quota and session-warning notifications with DND mode, cooldowns, and local event history.
- Local usage history retained in `~/.toki/usage-state.json`.
- Session mode for tracking quota burn during focused coding work.
- Settings tab for notifications, DND, thresholds, history retention, and menu bar display mode.
- Menu bar display modes for smart, lowest, Claude, Codex, combined, or account-count status.

## 2.0.5 - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Refactored monolithic 3166-line `main.swift` into ~30 files organized by concern (models, API, credentials, discovery, networking, utilities, views, config, store).
- Modularized all types into dedicated files for better maintainability and Swift 6 concurrency safety.
- Added GNU General Public License v3 and updated README license section.

## 2.0.4 - 2026-07-08

### Added

- CI workflow that automatically builds and attaches DMG to GitHub releases.

### Fixed

- Release CI uses `gh release create` instead of `upload` to handle fresh tag-triggered runs.

## 2.0.3 - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Debug mode accessible by tapping the version badge 5 times, showing live network request logs and error details.
- Universal binary build with DMG packaging in `scripts/package-release.sh`.
- CI workflow that automatically builds and attaches DMG to GitHub releases.

### Fixed

- Refresh guard now logs when skipped due to an in-progress refresh.

## 2.0 - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Rebranded the product from TokenBar to Toki, including package, executable, app bundle, docs, and visible app chrome.

- Swapped the popover header to a new `/toki` wallet-and-terminal app logo.
- Reworked README and repository docs for a more professional open-source project surface.
- Expanded the example config with `claudeSwapCommand`, `codexAuthPath`, and an optional manual ChatGPT ledger entry.
- Updated README guidance for the v2.0 UI and Codex logo resource.
- Moved header controls to the right side of the popover.
- Added provider-aware refresh throttling: Claude Code API calls paced at 7.5 minutes, Codex at 5-minute cadence, popover/manual reload at 1-minute floor.
- Handle 429 rate-limit responses by keeping the last good usage snapshot.

### Added

- Added the bundled Codex SVG logo resource and copy step for generated `.app` bundles.
